== FAQ ==

= Is Hyvor Talk free? =

Hyvor Talk is a **paid service** with generous tiers for small websites. The WordPress plugin is free to install. After installing, connect it to your Hyvor Talk website, which you can create at [Hyvor Talk Console](https://talk.hyvor.com/console). See our [pricing](https://talk.hyvor.com/pricing) for more details. We offer a 14-day free trial.

= How can I get support? =

You can contact us via live chat on our website (https://talk.hyvor.com) or email us at [talk.support@hyvor.com](mailto:talk.support@hyvor.com). If you have an issue with the WordPress plugin, you can create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyvor/hyvor-talk-wordpress-plugin).

= What does "privacy-focused" mean? =

Integrating third-party JavaScript snippets into websites is common but can impact privacy by giving these services access to user data, which is often sold to advertisers. Our privacy-first approach is different: we donâ€™t track, profile, or sell user data. We only collect minimal data needed for our service and charge a transparent fee, avoiding reliance on ads or data monetization.

= Where is data saved? =

Your website's data (comments, etc.) is saved in our secure servers located in Germany.

= What happens if I deactivate Hyvor Talk plugin on my website? =
You will no longer see the embeds on your website. You can reactivate the plugin at any time to get them back without losing any data.

= How can I customize the plugin? =

Our plugin itself is pluggable. It exposes multiple hooks that you can use to customize it. See [hooks docs](https://talk.hyvor.com/docs/wordpress#hooks) for more details.
